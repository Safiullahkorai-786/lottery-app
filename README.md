# lottery-app
A simple Flutter-based mobile application that simulates a lottery game. Users generate random numbers to match a predefined "lucky number," with the app tracking wins, losses, and total attempts. The UI provides visual feedback, turning green for wins and red for losses, making it engaging and intuitive.
